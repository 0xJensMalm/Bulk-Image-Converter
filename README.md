# Bulk Image Editor



## Overview / Generated by Chat-GPT. 

Bulk Image Editor is a Python-based GUI application for editing and converting image files in bulk. This project leverages the `tkinter` library for its GUI interface and `PIL` for image manipulation. The app is currently under construction ðŸš§.

## Features

- **Bulk Conversion**: Convert multiple image files to different formats like JPG, PNG, BMP, and GIF.
- **Dimension Resizing**: Set dimensions to resize your images.
- **Folder Selection**: Choose a folder to load its content and see all image files available.
- **Logs**: View activity logs to keep track of what the application has done.
  
## How to Use

1. **Load Folder Content**: Click the "Load Folder Content" button after specifying the directory in the Entry box. This will load all the image files in the folder to the Treeview.
  
2. **Set Image Dimensions**: Use the dimensions text fields to specify the width and height for resizing. Click "Set" to confirm.
  
3. **Select File Type**: Use the dropdown menu to select the file type you wish to convert the images to.
  
4. **Output Folder**: Click "Select Output Folder" to specify where the converted files should go. You can also create a new output folder by clicking "New Output Folder".

## Dependencies

- `tkinter` for GUI
- `PIL` (Pillow) for image operations
- `os` for directory and file manipulation

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tk
pip install Pillow
```

## Usage

To run the application, execute the script `your_script_name.py`.

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

## Codebase Status

- **Complete**: The code for displaying original and output files in the Treeview, fetching and setting the image dimensions, selecting output folder, and logging activities is complete.
- **Under Construction**: The code for the actual image conversion and resizing functionalities is under development.
